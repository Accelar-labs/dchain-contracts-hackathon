# frax-depin-protocol
<br/>
Integrate depin chains on Dchain - modular connections by oracles - Based on web3 onchain games. Currently connecting with https://akash.network/docs/
<br/>
<br/>

Dchain Testnet DPL deployment: 0x087E1aEAa851A278cddC14cB5Eb96025D610551f
<br/>
ICP oracle hash: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/saeiq-taaaa-aaaao-a3ctq-cai - created by Omnia protocol: https://github.dev/omnia-network/ic_akash/tree/main/frontend
<br/>

Accelar oracle based on https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/threshold-ecdsa
<br/>
zk_proof_dchain based on https://github.dev/zCloak-Network/icp-zk-maze/tree/main/src/zkmaze_backend
<br/>

This protocol is a beta deployment, use accelar_dchain_dao_sample to deploy a dao capable to manage the modular protocol.
